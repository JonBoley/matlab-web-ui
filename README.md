matlab-web-ui
=============

The idea here is to use the web for simple Matlab GUIs.
For example, let's just say you want to ask the user "A or B?". Matlab would send appropriate info to the web, the options are presented, and anyone viewing the page could respond. Matlab receives the response, and can process it.

This repo just handles the website.
